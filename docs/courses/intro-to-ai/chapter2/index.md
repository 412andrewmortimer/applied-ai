# Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents

## Introduction
In this chapter, we explore the concept of **intelligent agents**, their design principles, and their interaction with various environments. The goal is to make the notion of **rational agents**, introduced in Chapter 1, more concrete and applicable to a wide range of scenarios.

### Key Themes:
- **Nature of Agents**: What defines an agent and its role in interacting with its environment.
- **Rationality**: The behavior of agents and the measure of their performance.
- **Environments**: The characteristics of environments that agents operate in.
- **Agent Types**: The diversity of agent designs suited for different environments.
